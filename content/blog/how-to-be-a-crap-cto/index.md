**Disclaimer**: **THIS IS A PARODY**. Please don't actually do any of this. This is a non-comprehensive list of what not to do as a CTO, or in fact - as a human being. The below is loosely based on random notes I made about people I have met throughout my career but also about observations I have made about myself and mistakes I have made.

## It's all about perception

You don't need to actually be able to write code or work hard. But make sure the board thinks you do. Always go on about how hard you work at standup and how you have to.

## Whatever happens - it is not your responsibilty

This is the golden rule. 

## Be as inconsistent as possible

Have 1on1 with one person but not with another.

## Very casually say inappropriate things

I care where you're from and 

## Treat everyone the same, whether they are doing things or aren't
