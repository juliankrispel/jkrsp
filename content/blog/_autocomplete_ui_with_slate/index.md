Disclaimer: I'm using typescript for this and all my tutorials

### Setup 

To get setup quickly, please use [this minimal slate-js boilerplate](https://github.com/juliankrispel/slate-js-boilerplate) as a starting point.

1. `git clone git@github.com:juliankrispel/slate-js-boilerplate.git my-editor`
2. `cd my-editor`
3. `yarn start`

After running the above 3 commands in your terminal you can go to `localhost:1234` to see the default slate editor in your browser.
