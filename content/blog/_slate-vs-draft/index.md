You're building the next big text-editing interface and need a powerful library that integrates with react.

A search that will most likely lead you to the inevitable fork in the road: Should you use [__Draft.js__](https://draftjs.org/) or [__Slate.js__](https://www.slatejs.org/)?

What follows is a comparison based on facts, opinions and experience working with both draft.js and slate.js as a text-editing consultant for several years.

### Licensing

Fortunately, both projects use MIT at the time of writing this article. This wasn't always the case for Draft.js hover (nor React.js for that matter). After significant [public outcry] over facebooks previous (predatory) licensing model draft.js [has been relicensed to use MIT](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/1967).

### Type system

Slate.js uses typescript and has excellent support for it. For example, with the current release users are able to define the types of nodes that [slate uses](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/12-typescript#defining-editor-element-and-text-types).

Draft.js on the other hand uses [Flow], Facebooks alternative type checker. 5 years on, it's clear that typescript has won the "type-wars" and there is little use of Flow outside of facebook.

However, [@typed/draft-js] is an npm package that enables typescript support for draft.js, which makes this much less of an issue.

### Documentation

This is a point where draft.js clearly wins. 

### Data structure

Draft.js uses immutable.js

### Maturity / Stability

Slate.js is still in beta and as such breaking changes are not uncommon.
Draft.js


### Open source

Imo the best measure of this is to compare https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/commits/master

### Size

Draft.js: ~ 170kb incl deps
Slate.js: ~ 80kb incl deps

Size matters. Currently Including dependencies slate.js clocks in at less than half the size of draft.js. Draft.js's dependency on immutable.js makes up a lot of that.
