Here's something that caught me out when working on an editor with slate.js this week:

When duplicating one or more nodes inside a document (In my case I needed this for a custom implementation of dragging content from one point to another), you must deep-clone the nodes before inserting them (via `Tranform.insertNodes` for example).

Slate.js relies on [object equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) to assign keys to tree nodes. Having two nodes with the same key in the tree will likely cause exceptions for any operations that follow.

In order to duplicate a selection or a list of nodes we need to create new object instances for every node and every respective child node in this list of nodes.

Here's a simple function for recursively rendering a tree of slate nodes:

```tsx
import { Descendant, Element } from "slate";

export function cloneChildren(children: Descendant[]): Descendant[] {
  return children.map((node) => {
    if (Element.isElement(node)) {
      return {
        ...node,
        children: cloneChildren(node.children),
      };
    }

    return { ...node };
  });
}
```

That is pretty much all you need. Now you can duplicate nodes safely.

Like a fragment for example (which is a list of nodes)

```tsx
const frag = editor.fragment()
editor.insertFragment(cloneChildren(frag))
```

ðŸ’¡ If you're already using lodash, you could use their [cloneDeep method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#cloneDeep) instead, which is a more general solution and applies to any javascript object (even special objects like buffers, symbols or typed arrays).
